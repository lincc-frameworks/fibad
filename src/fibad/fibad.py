            Logging setup for a fibad object is global loggers named "fibad.*" If you want to turn off
            logging config for "fibad.*" python loggers, pass False here. By default True.

            You may want to set this to True if:
            - You have multiple Fibad objects in your application or notebook, and would like to control
              which of their logging configs is used globally. By creating one of your objects with
              setup_logging=True and the others with setup_logging=False, the single object created with
              setup_logging=True will control where the log is emitted to and what the threshold level is.
            - You have another library which needs overall control over python logging's config, and you
              do not want fibad to alter any global logging config. In this case you should always pass
              setup_logging=False. Fibad will stil send logs into python logging; however, the other
              system will be responsible for where those logs are emitted, and what the threshold level
              is.

            You may want to leave the default of setup_logging=True if:
            - You have a single Fibad object in use at any time. This is true in most notebook like
              environments.

        # fibad have already been configured by another object!

        #
        # 1) A notebook user has a cell with `fibad_instance = fibad.Fibad()` and they run this multiple times
        #    in the same kernel process. If this person is changing any logging in their fibad config file
        #    and rerunning (perhaps to debug an issue) they likely expect the most recently __init__()ed
        #    fibad object to control their logging.
        #
        # 2) An application (or notebook) user configures multiple Fibad instance objects intending to use
        #    several different configs. If the logging configs differ between those objects we don't have a
        #    clear choice about what the global fibad logging config ought be, unless the user tells us
        #    somehow.
        #
        # In the face of this tension we allow a kwarg to be passed (setup_logging) which defaults to True

        # initialized object controls global logging.
