            Directory where the cutuout files ought live. Used to generate file names on the rect object.
        offset : int, optional
            Index to start the `lineno` field in the rects at, by default 0. The purpose of this is to allow
            multiple downloads on different sections of a larger source list without file name clobbering
            during the download phase. This is important because `lineno` in a rect can becomes a file name
            parameter The offset is intended to be the index of the start of the locations table within some
            larger fits file.
        default : dC.Rect, optional
            The default Rect that contains properties common to all sky locations, by default None

        fields : list[str], optional
            Default fields to pull from the locations table. If not provided, defaults to
            ["tract", "ra", "dec"]
