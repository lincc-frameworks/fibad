How to define subsets of data
=============================

Talk about the approach we've taken with train, validate, and test.

Perhaps a flow chart would be good here.

Describe how this can be used as percentages or absolute numbers.

Describe how the splits can be used to accomplish different modes of training.
i.e. train/validate then infer on test splits,
train for epochs, validate after each, then run test set at the very end.
Only train for epochs (no validation) then infer on test split... etc.
